PGV

    Polynomial Graphical Viewer

    I am personally planning to use it for simple terrain generation 
    as an alternative to noise maps.

TECHNICALS 

    The underlying API renderer is BGFX. Source code is in C++. 
    Intermediate GUI is ran with the help of dear-imgui and a 
    custom port of it to BGFX - which I took from the bigg 
    framework (bgfx + imgui + glfw + glm).

    For the time being, this remains tested only on a modern 
    Linux kernel. Patches and pull requests that highten the 
    project's value or make it cross-platform are more than 
    welcome. For any technical questions regarding the tool's 
    source code, please contact me via email.
